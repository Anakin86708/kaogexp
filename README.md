## Using

The KAOGExp can be used creating an object from `KAOGExp`. To explain one instance, you can use the method `explicar()`,
that requires some parameters like the method to use (`Counterfactual` or anything implementing `MethodAbstract`), the
data cleaner and the normalizer associated with the dataset and model.

More documentation should be added later.
